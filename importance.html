<p>The cardiovascular system is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the body. It delivers oxygen and nutrients to cells, removes waste products, and plays a vital role in the immune response, hormone transport, and temperature regulation. It is also involved in the regulation of blood pressure and the distribution of heat throughout the body.</p>
<p>Proper cardiovascular health is essential for overall well-being. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and managing stress are some lifestyle factors that can promote cardiovascular health. It is important to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors and seek medical attention if any cardiovascular issues or symptoms arise.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Function</strong>: The heart's main function is to pump blood throughout the body. It does this through a series of coordinated contractions called cardiac cycles. During each cycle, the heart contracts and relaxes, allowing blood to flow in a specific direction. The contraction phase is called systole, and the relaxation phase is called diastole.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Coronary Circulation</strong>: The heart itself needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly. The coronary arteries, which branch off the aorta, provide this blood supply to the heart muscle. When these arteries become narrowed or blocked due to a buildup of plaque (atherosclerosis), it can lead to coronary artery disease and potentially a heart attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blood Pressure</strong>: Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels. It is measured using two values: systolic pressure (the higher value when the heart contracts) and diastolic pressure (the lower value when the heart relaxes). Blood pressure is an important indicator of cardiovascular health, and high blood pressure (hypertension) can strain the heart and blood vessels over time.</p>
